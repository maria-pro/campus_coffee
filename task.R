have an idea for something interesting we could do with the mapping data.

Iâ€™d like to map how many cafes and restaurants there are on TAFE and university campuses in Australia.

There are reasons for this that I can explain later (basically TAFEs report they have 1000s of students but they are never there).

What we can do is:

  Collect the data from OSM which has the polygons of all universities and tafes
Send the data to google to get a list of the cafes/restaurants
Do a count of cafes and restaurants and then compare to enrolment numbers.

I have started with the OSM information already:

  b <- getbb("Victoria, Australia") %>%
  opq(timeout = 1000) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = c("university","college"))
vic <- b$osm_polygons

I wondered whether this might be a neat project to showcase on the r journal somewhere.

Let me know what you think. If you are free perhaps, we can have a quick chat this afternoon.
